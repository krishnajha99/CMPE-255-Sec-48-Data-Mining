# Implement Various clustering algorithms in colabs

The goal is to demonstrate how to implement various clustering algorithms in colabs

- K-Means clustering
  Colab Link for K-Means clustering - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t_DOppGjsTrv1bNdseb3NC67O3bj1pUL?usp=sharing">Google Colab Link</a>

- Hierarchical clustering 
- Gaussian mixture models clustering
- DB Scan clustering

<b> Summary: </b>
Based on above analysis K-means outperforms GMM based on all cluster validation metrics.
